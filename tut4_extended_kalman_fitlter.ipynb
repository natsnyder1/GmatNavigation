    "Welcome to tutorial 4! You've braved it so far, lets put everything together and build an EKF for Orbit Determination using GMAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most pieces required to simulate the EKF using GMAT have already been introduced (see tutorials one to three). Lets start by running an EKF simulation with a \"really good\" GPS point solution as its measurement. The better the measurement, the better you will track your solve for states. Solve for states are generally hard to observe, requiring long estimation horizons to track. We can show, however, that by simulating a \"really good\" GPS point solution, you can track your solve fors very well. This, at the very least, shows that the partial derivative information returned in the jacobian (and used by the EKF via the STM), is accurate. We'll simulate realistic GPS point solutions as measurements afterwards, where you'll then see that the EKF has a much harder time tracking solve-fors.\n",

    "As we can see above, the EKF is doing what we'd expect: Its tracking changes in Cd very well. Position and velocity are tracked near perfect. If you wish, add $C_r$ as a solve for state above. You will see that even with such favorable noise settings, estimating $C_r$'s solve for is still challenging. \n",
    "\n",
    "The previous simulation, of course, is not realistic. For starters, the GPS noise standard deviation was set to 7.5 micrometers: a near perfect measurement. In reality, this is more like 7.5 meters. The Power Spectral Density of acceleration noise was also set extremely small, leading to a position uncertainty (standard deviation) of $8.485e$-$7$ meters over a propagation step of 60 seconds, and a velocity uncertainty (standard deviation) of $2.49e$-$8$ meters/sec over a propagation interval of 60 seconds. This implies we are extremely confident in our model. In practice, a slight perturbation or modelling error could lead to filter divergence with such a tiny process noise (you can try this yourself: generate measurements with one satellite model, and use a similar but different model for the EKF). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move on to a more realistic simulation, where the GPS noise standard deviation is instead 7.5 meters. We will also turn the filter's process noise up (position uncertainty of 0.268 meters per propagation of dt=60 sec, and velocity uncertainty of 7.75 millimeters/second per propagation of dt=60sec). Doing so tells the filter we are much less confident (than before) in our model. The code below is a copy and paste of that above, with only the measurement + process noise changed as suggested.

The estimation errors deviate outside their respective 1-sigma bound only slightly more than if $C_d$ was forced by a Gaussian. However, the estimator still performs well, despite the large change to $C_d$. This, more than anything, confirms that our process noise PSD choice of 1e-15 (for position and velocity) works well to keep the filter robust to impulsive forcing in $C_d$.\n",
