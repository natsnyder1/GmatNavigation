Welcome to the GMAT Navigation tutorial series using Python! This set of tutorials guides you through incorporating GMAT into your own navigation (estimation) applications. Specifically, this guide shows how to use the GMAT Python API to construct basic features required in practically all estimation algorithms. Please note that installing GMAT is not apart of this tutorial series. Installation of GMAT is covered in several external documentation sources, such as here: https://github.com/ChristopherRabotin/GMAT/tree/GMAT-2020a

Tutorials are presented using Jupyter Notebook. If you do not have this package downloaded, you can do so with pip: i.e., 

pip install notebook 

If using a package manager, such as conda, you can instead run "conda install anaconda::notebook" or consult other online installation isntructions. In either case, you can launch a tutorial using the "jupyter notebook" command. For example,

jupyter notebook tut1_getting_started.ipynb

will launch the first tutorial. Viewing the tutorials through vscode is another great option (and is my preference), which is made possible possible through the jupyter extension tools that vscode provides. Additionally, this will allow you to step through code blocks and set break points, which is very nice extra.

Enjoy!
