    "The state transition matrix (STM) can be computed in a variety of ways. An easy solution, for relatively small time steps, is to use a power series approximation. This approximation gets better and better for smaller time increments. Mathematically, a simple approximation to the STM for a nonlinear continous time dynamic system $\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x_{t_k})$ with time step $\\Delta = t_{k+1}-t_k$ can be found as\n",

For example, given that $A$ is a square matrix, $A^3 = A\\cdot A \\cdot A$.  Using the jacobian we've already computed, this is a cinch. \n",

    "You may be wondering why, similar to obtaining the Jacobian, we don't just ask GMAT for the STM. Unfortunately, GMAT's API does not provide this feature out-of-the-box.

First, computing the averaged jacobian $\\bar{J} = \\frac{\\nabla_x{f(x_{t_{k+1}})} + \\nabla_x{f(x_{t_k})}}{2}$ will result in a better approximation to the Jacobian over the time increment $\\Delta$. To do so, we would need to first find the jacobian at $x_{t_{k}}$, invoke the propagator to get to $x_{t_{k+1}}$, then find the jacobian at $x_{t_{k+1}}$. This may be good enough for a small time increment $\\Delta$. Second, smaller time steps yield a better STM approximation, as was alluded to before. One can create a much better STM approximation by computing a sequence of STMs for substeps $\\Delta_s < \\Delta$ and multiplying the results together. Let $\\{x_{t_k}, x_{t_{k+\\frac{1}{s}}}, x_{t_{k+\\frac{2}{s}}}, ..., x_{t_{k+1}}\\}$ refer to the trajectory of states between $x_{t_k}$ and $x_{t_{k+1}}$, with $s$ the number of substeps taken.

For example, the drag coefficient could be replaced as $C_d = C_{d0}(1 + \\frac{dC_d}{C_{d0}})$ where $C_{d0}$ is our nominal guess for the coefficient of drag, $\\frac{dC_d}{C_{d0}}$ is our $\\textit{solve for state}$ (change in coefficient of drag) and\n",

    "where above, $\\phi_X(\\nu)$ denotes the CF with $\\nu\\in\\mathbb{R}$ the spectral variable, $\\sigma>0$ is a scaling parameter describing the \"width\" of the distribution (think of standard deviation), $\\alpha \\in (0,2]$ classifies how rare \"heavy-tailed\" events are, and $b\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is the location parameter describing the value for which the distribution is centered about. Typically $b=0$, as noise distributions are usually zero-centered. When $\\alpha=2$, the inverse CF yields the Gaussian pdf, whereas setting $\\alpha=1$ yields the Cauchy distribution. We can think of the spectrum of $\\alpha$ as a way to classify how likely the occurence of a rare, outlier event is. As $\\alpha$ is lowered from $2$ (Gaussian) to $1$ (Cauchy), the occurence of rare events have much more likelihood, as the amount of mass in the tail of the pdf increases. This is a better definition of \"heavy-tailed\" (i.e, $\\alpha<2$). \n",
    "\n",
    "For $\\alpha\\in(1,2)$, the closed form pdf for the inverse to the CF above does not exist. However, we can certainly still sample from distribution with $1 < \\alpha < 2$, using methods from literature. The EarthOrbitingSatellite class allows for the inclusion of solve for states. Specifically, $C_d$ and $C_r$ are already baked in. The class allows modelling of solve for states using a first order markov (FOM) model. Additionally, we can set the noise distribution to anything with $\\alpha\\in[1,2]$, meaning we can simulate Gaussian noises (set $\\alpha=2$) and all the way down to Cauchy noise (set $\\alpha=1$). Generally, the distribution of space weather parameters are best modelled by something in between Gaussian and Cauchy, for example, $\\alpha=1.5$. Of course, this requires careful analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll show how to add solve for states that are Gaussian forced. Then well do the same for solve-fors that follow a $S-\\alpha-S$ distribution for $\\alpha < 2$ (Non-Gaussian). "

    "Now is also a good time too to comment on the simulate(...) function above. It runs a full dynamic simulation, returning the states, simulated gps measurements, process noise samples from the realization, and measurement noise samples from the realization. In a simulation enviroment, this function provides the measurements a Kalman filter would process, but also returns the true simulation states, as well as the simulated process/measurement noises, respectively. The GPS sensor's noise standard deviation must be specified for the measurements, which is assumed Gaussian. Assigning a std. dev. of zero returns a perfect measurement and of course no corruptive noise. Additive process noise is only added to position and velocity during the simulation if you assign a covariance matrix to argument 'W' in the function call. Otherwise, no additive position/veloicty process noise is simulated. Additionally, the simulated GPS point solutions (the measurements) are returned in the earth body fixed frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time \"step()\" is internally called inside simulate(..), both the satellite position/velocity updates, along with each added solve for state. Moreover, the solve for states are given a \"noisy\" propagation in simulate(...). Meaning, a sample is drawn from your solve-for's assigned noise distribution, and is added via the FO(G)M model suggested above. This of course then affects your simulated position and velocity state trajectories; as after the solve for is propagated, the new (noisy) nominal value is re-assigned to GMAT via a SetField call (see source code, its not terribly complicated). Now, we have a way to simulate atmosphere changes, and see the dynamic affect on position/velocity. \n",

    "If you run the above cell block several times, you will see that the Coefficient of Drag sometimes has large impulsive changes. This is consistent with space weather data analysis for changes in atmospheric density (equivalently a modeled solve for state on Cd), coefficient of reflectivity, and others. Lowering the alpha-value even further results in more frequent and larger impulses. \n",
