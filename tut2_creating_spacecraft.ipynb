Here, we are constructing a four body problem with the most dominant (non-central) forces the satellite is subject to (sun, moon). In total, Satellite + Earth + Sun + Moon yields a four body problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "> 4.) Add Atmospheric Drag: Typically, this is the most dominant perturbation force acting on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. This force acts opposite to the direction of travel and is due to the satellite passing through (the thin) atmosphere at its orbital height. Accurate modelling of which is difficult. However, GMAT provides a high fidelity drag model known as Jacchia Roberts, but requires a space weather file. GMAT will use a default space weather source, if not provided.
